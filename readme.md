One of the coolest projects I had the chance to work on. 💻

This is a web-app for `Brigham and Women's Hospital` located in Boston, MA. This app is to be integrated on kiosks at the hospital. 

I worked with 9 other very talented students to get this up and running. 🏃

Some cool features I worked on ✌🏽🧑🏽‍💻

- Pathfinding inside the hospital to go from point A to point B.
- Three different graph traversal algorithms implemented: A*, Dijkstra, DFS.
- Upload and export of all nodes from the PostgreSQL database that constitute the graph of the hospital.
- Implemented multi-floor support for pathfinding.

Overall, I have contributed as much as I could in all parts of the project. I had the role of Lead Full-Stack Software Engineer.

Hope you enjoy this 💪🏽
